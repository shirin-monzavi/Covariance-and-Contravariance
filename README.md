This is a sample project for Covariance and Contravariance in C#.
Covariance and contravariance allow us to be flexible when dealing with class hierarchy.

Covariance:
Covariance allows you to use a derived class where a base class is expected.

Contravariance:
Contravariance is applied to parameters. 
Contravariance allows a method with the parameter of a base class to be assigned to a delegate that expects the parameter of a derived class.
